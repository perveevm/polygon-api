# polygon-api

This project implements all Polygon API methods described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mb6CDWpbLQsi7F5UjAdwXdbCpyvSgWSXTJVHl52zZUQ/edit#heading=h.7qf3ungxcp7r). If there are any errors in the implementation of some methods, contact me, and I'll fix them.

### Building

Just call `mvn package`, it will build `polygon-api-VERSION.jar` file for you.

### Usage

The main class is `PolygonSession`. It implements all API methods. Constructor takes two parameters â€“ `key` and `secret`. You can get them in your profile settings on Polygon.

All entity classes, for example, `Problem`, `ProblemPackage`, etc., are in the `ru.perveevm.polygon.api.entities` package.

### Dependencies

All dependencies that were used you can find in `pom.xml` config file.
